<p>Welcome to our <b>Targeted Editing</b> series where today you can figure out how to cook with thyme, or make <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data sublime! (Both take about the same amount of time.)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li><b>How are airport polygons used?</b>
          <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Help with map rendering.  No, this doesn&#39;t mean we need help adding a layer of sand and cement, this means help with how things are cartographically displayed on the map.  A map label for a point is great to have, but a polygon is even better. It adds more detail and visual appeal.</li> 
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with display order.  In many cases, the size of an airport indicates significance.  When airports have polygons, the size of the airport can be used to determine how much you should zoom in to the map before it appears.  Bigger airports can be shown sooner than smaller airports.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with search rank.  When searching, a search engine can use a number of things to prioritize what features are returned.  Some examples might be associated attributes like type, or even the physical size of a feature.  Since points have no area, adding a polygon could be an excellent enhancement.</li>
            </ol>

        <li><b>We are missing some airport polygons here!</b>

            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check out this pie chart for airports in the Bay Area:</li>
                <div id="airport_polygon_piechart" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
                <li>Regional airports need some love.</li>

        <li><b>How you can help improve airports without polygons:</b>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Here is a map styled by <a href="https://github.com/meetar">Peter Richardson</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/nvkelso">Nathaniel V. Kelso</a> showing airports that don&#39;t have polygons.  To add a polygon for an airport that is only represented by a point, click one of the bright blue highlighted airport points to bring up an info bubble with links to editing tools that can be used to add features.</li>

                </p> 
                 
                <p></p> 
                  <ul>See the wiki pages for <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:aeroway%3Daerodrome">aeroway=aerodrome.</a></ul>
                <p></p>
                <ul>(If you find an airport that appears to have a polygon, but it's still highlighted, you may have found a duplicate or a building that was tagged aeroway=aerodrome instead of the airport grounds.  Improving those is a topic for another post...)</ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>Not familiar with the Bay Area?  Search for your home town or one near it and pan over to an area you know.</li>
